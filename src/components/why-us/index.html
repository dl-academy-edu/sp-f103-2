            and a healthy home. Our proprietary hot carbonating extraction cleaning process penetrates deep into the
            fibers,
            removing an average of 98% of common household allergens from carpets, upholstery and rugs and 89% of the
            airborne bacteria in your home when a sanitizer is added.* Plus, our green-certified solution, The Natural®,
            contains no soaps or detergents so it’s safe and non-toxic for your family and pets.</p>
